Statistical programming for clinical trials is moving towards a multi-language environment where submissions to regulatory agencies may include code written in SAS, R and other languages. The mission of this working group is to develop the content for a process to certify that statistical programmers have the basic skills to function effectively in a mixed SAS and R clinical trial programming environment. 

Topics will include:
* FDA CDISC Standards
* Relevant SAS and R data structures
* The basics of managing SAS and R environments 
* Reporting methods in SAS and R
* Developing tests to compare the results of SAS and R analyses.
