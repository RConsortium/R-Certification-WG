    "text": "This is the introduction to the R Cert WG\n\n\nStatistical programming for clinical trials is moving towards a multi-language environment where submissions to regulatory agencies may include code written in SAS, R and other languages (e.g. python, STATA, etc). The mission of this working group is to develop the content for a process to certify that statistical programmers have the basic skills to function effectively in a mixed SAS and R clinical trial programming environment.The R Certification Working Group (R Cert WG) was established to bring about programmatic assessment and confidence to those seeking to advance their career in R within a clinical environment.\n\n\n\nThe R Cert WG developed a mock exam for those seeking accreditation in R for a clinical analyst. The following areas were assess:\n\nCDISC Standards and GCP Knowledge\nRelevant SAS and R data structures\nThe basics of managing SAS and R datasets\nThe basics of performing EDA and modeling in R\nReporting methods in SAS and R"
