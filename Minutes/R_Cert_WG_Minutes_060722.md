Meeting Minutes 06Jul2022


Kat and Dan both serve at the training team at Janseen 
	--> Kat handles the live training piece and coordinates the differences 
		--> Has been at Janseen here for 20 years 
		--> Mostly SAS based work 
		--> Started dipping toes into R few years 


Janseen Approach (Dan):

--> Janseen folks would be interested in certified in X
	--> Not necessarily someone that needs to be fluent in AdAM, but what would be attractive would be someone that is not 
	only capable of getting to AdAM but into TLFs
	--> Need to take away some of the fear of going into R 
	--> We need to give an intro to basics 
		--> how to get a dataset into a dataframe and have it useful to get an output for the SAS programmer 
			--> Now we have to circle back and do the fundamentals
	--> Need to learn the data structures, factors, and the basics of the R programming language 
	--> Core certification that would be interesting would need to get an understanding of the tidyverse and TLFs
		--> Get the fundamentals of R and producing the scripts 
	--> Is the CDISC piece something that we need to worry about?
		--> Everything that they said would be something to consider 
			--> We would want to take the CDISC standard as a given 
				--> People tend to gravitate towards the standards group
	--> There is a fundamental gap in the R knowledge 
	--> Most of the clinical programmers will turn to the statistician and ask for the code snippet

Reporting Package --> This is the least important part of things. When you've read in the data for the analysis dataset, what if anything data manipulation wise needs to be performed. 
	--> Before they had any access they used the huxtable package for the reporting of the final output. 

** If you need any more help please reach out for some CDISC help**


Joe R: 
	--> Tables working group is working on a table for the canonical tables that can be used for the TLFs 
		--> We can then assume that depending on the disposition of the WG they can help with the background 
			--> Why these tables are important, the architect type they fit into 
	--> All of the company members believe that R certification is important 
	--> There is a large gap for the tidyverse datasets and some industries. 
		--> Lacks a set of standard in industry. Is this something we have to be worried about?
	--> There is going to be a change in the programming world where statisticians will be programming more  

	
Phuse: 

Clinical Statisical Reporting in a multilingual World
	--> trying to investigate the analysis in SAS and R and see why they dont see the same thing 

Platform (next meeting topic): 

--> Need something to build on 



Assignments: 

--> Send updated list 
--> Need new invite
