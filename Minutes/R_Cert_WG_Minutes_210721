07/21/21: Joe R, Kiernan M., Joe K., Kate O., Mehar Singh, Rafi K.

Updates from Joe R.
PHUSE WG on Clinical Statistics in a Multilingual World.
	a number of groups: survival, mixed models, linear models
	- Discrepancies between SAS/R
	- Looking at interesting discrepancies - some with statistical theory, e.g. estimators
	- Upshot of this: will really focus and blowback on statisticians (where it should reside). For what you're doing, is this what you should use? Their work will be raw material for what we do here.
	- Need them to put it in a place that we can point to.
Submissions WG
	- Planning a series of submission, each more complicated
	- R Consortium will be "sponsor" for this clinical trial
	- Have received credentials to get this through the gateway. This will be a big deal.
	- By Fall we should be ready for pilot submission.
	- Trying to work out project plan, etc.
	- Support of FDA (2 FDA Ethan Chang Gateway Submissions process, and Paul Schutte)
Funds
	- Directed Funding PHUSE paying members can direct an allocation of funds to specific R Consortium projects. 
	- Good - money and what for?
	- Should we put it in the planning for the future
	- TASK: send these ideas to Joe R. 
		○ Examples: R Validation Hub: hired a consultant for risk metric and software
		○ Examples: groups (R Ladies, others)
		○ Examples: recent work in spacial statistics ICS grants
	- Bar is high: must be useful

Mehar: down the line: taking a test, no cheating, accountability; some might be covered by cost of certification; some may be investment from consortium; 
	- Basic financial analysis that Mehar did, can bring that to the group.

Next Meeting 08/11/21
