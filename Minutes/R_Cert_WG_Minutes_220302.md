**General** 

Foreign Aid --> education for outreach for spatial statistics. Have an idea for a badging system
		--> Build a learn R kind of lessons for attendees. 
			--> Lead to a discussion for the board meeting 
			--> Exploring certification for a revenue generating 


**Content for SAS programming to the R programming** 
	--> Do we want to take a step back for this group and attempt to do a badge (Certify)
	--> Does the badge require pre-req or is one and done?


**Educational Content**: 

	--> Kieran has a meeting with Robert Adams 
		--> Have a SAS to R course
		--> Could bring this into the space potentially 


**People**: 

	--> Joe K to sync with Bella Feng 
	--> Joe R to reach out to to R for SAS Users/SPSSS author (Robert A. Muenchen)
	--> Joe K to follow up with Kate for support


**Phuse**:

	--> may 1-4 is the Phuse working group for CDISC partner event (costly)
		--> Phuse-US connect is a big deal going forward 


**Actions**: 

	--> Joe K to evaluate the event for the R Phuse -CDISC conference and see if its worth going 
		--> Check to see if worth having R Consortium fund this event 
		--> Kieran to investigate from Roche to see if there will be anyone involved 
	--> Joe K update the modeling and finalize modeling 
	--> Kaitilin add documentation for the Exam Structure to GitHub
	--> Mike G to update Foundational skills md	
	--> Joe R "Finding Stuff in R"
	--> Keiran to create "Guide to Help Files"
	--> Joe K to update meeting from Teams to Zoom 




**Foundational Skills**: 
	--> Less history of SAS and more of the preveleance of SAS in the clinical signifance of R in the SAS world
	--> Biggest Difference --> point to the Phuse working group in the multilingual world 
		--> Reconciling the output between the two languages 
		--> Recognizing the differences and the path forward for the two language 
	--> Debugging --> Dont want to go into debugging SAS. "Unlike SAS kind of thing comes up." 
			--> R should emphasize debugging tools. 
				--> Start off with whats available in R Studio. Breakpoints, and point to some documentation. Paragraph to point to test at for unit tests. (focus on analysts and not R developers)
	--> Remove "Solving Problems in SAS and R"
	--> Data Manipulation --> Could mention that you dont need to know SQL in R. Can do basic SQL knowledge in tidyverse. Discuss how you can get to the SQL knowledge in R. [add reference to tidyverse manipulation]
	--> Data Structures --> add in %in% for indexing in R for subsetting. 
	--> I/O --> touch up on Rdata objects and have references for data. Point to libraries for reading data. 
		--> RDS over reading in R data objects as well
		--> Discuss libraries such as "readR"
		--> Assume reader is capable to has 
	--> Add in discussing good programming practices in R. Reading pathways, maintaining environment in R. This would be something that is new to a SAS pgoramming. Discussion around Profiles and setting options in R. 
	--> Add in some work with non-"Tidy" data. Put some dicussion around this work as well. 
	--> Add some reference for RCP and C code. Maybe a brief section about performance. 
	--> People may not have knowledge of "where" the libraries are coming from. We should have some reference about local, public, CRAN repos for use case. 
		--> You need to think about what versions where things are. Lesser extent of version of R. 
	--> Add some section about "finding" stuff in R. (Joe R).
		--> Mention something about Taskviews, CRANLY, and finding things in R in general. 
	--> Short guide on how to read R help files. (Kieran)
		--> Have multiple functions on the same page
