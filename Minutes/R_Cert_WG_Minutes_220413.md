### Exam Content: 

#### Modelling: 
* Typically statisticians tell prgorammers which model to execute
    - Is R cert breaking that hierarchy? 
    - Who is this cert for? Target candidate?                       
    <br>         
    
* Greater emphasis on descriptive statistics vs modelling in clinical programming

* Give high level overview of models commonly used 
    - Survival
    - Mixed effect
    <br>   
    
* Modelling is more advanced teir (accoridng to SAS exams)
    - Teired certs?   
    <br>     
    
* Are modelling questions going to be based on domain knowledge (eg: when/what to use it for) or programming based (eg:which code performs x model)? Both? 
    - Given x model which code is relevant?  
    <br>

    - Being able to manipulate data important (grouping, transposing, frequencies)

#### Exam Pre Reqs 

* Assuming folks are comfortable with Statistics and know how to code in R 


#### Misc

* Take into consideration different clinical settings 
* Individuals have differential techniques/ ways of doing within clinical industry 
* Clinical community has own set of requirements based on department (eg: oncology, neuro..)
