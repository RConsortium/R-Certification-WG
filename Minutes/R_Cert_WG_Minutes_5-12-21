Attendance: Joe R., Kate O., Mike G., Kevin B. 

Updates from Joe R on R Consortium WGs:
R Validation Hub:

R Consortium Updates:
	- package wrapper -- pilot submission
	- To do this, could R Cons be the sponsor? 
	- R Cons is writing to the FDA and see if they can do it.

R Tables WG:
	- Lots of progress.
	- Developing tables for different parts of a submission document.
	- Using CDISC datasets
	- Discussions around workflows

PHUSE WG: 
	- Mike Stackhouse
	- Closest to what we are doing
	- Clinical Reporting in a multilingual world
	- SAS results vs R outputs for canonical analyses for clinical submissions (linear, mixed, MH tests, etc.)
	- Methodology, results, documentation, others to follow….
  - PHUSE seems to have a safety slant

Overlap, energy, attention from Pharma in these efforts.

Selecting an example workflow/process for training:

Safety example
	1. Raw data (clinical database) --> 
	2. normalization (SDTM, internal standard) --> 
	3. reporting standard (IND, Safety Monitoring)

Actions
	1. QC on the raw data --> 
	2. mapping the data to "norm" / specifications --> 
  3. programming of that dataset
	4. annotate mocks --> 
	5. programming of that TLF 

Additional Actions:
	1. Verification and double programming
	2. Efficacy Example (vs Safety) for additional actions/processes (Kiernan)
	3. Visualization: graphs and interactive reports (R Shiny)
		a. Hands-on vs exec SAS programmer (why do I need to go from SAS to R)
		b. Business case: 
			i. Efficiency (Shiny vs SAS time to create/update)
			ii. Effectiveness (correct visualization of data)
	4. Maintenance
		a. (Nadia Eghbal - open source)

Take action into a module of sorts:
- SAS QCs --> R QCs
- Split out R technical differences vs Clinical trials operations/documentation (that wouldn’t be as familiar for R programmers)
- Use sample datasets
- Translation and Replication: we don't want to simply replicate the code a la SAS, but we want to find a balance between the process of what we use SAS to accomplish and the best practice for R, building good R code.

R Certification:
Certifying people to work in the Clinical Trials environment ("mixed language environment"). Things you should know:
	- R technical points relevant to CTs
	- CTs workflows and tie-ins to Programmatic efforts
	- Relevant to a mixed-programming environment (need programmers to move from SAS to R to others (python))

Is it for the team? For the individual?
It's support for the process of transition out of SAS and into either mixed or R programmatic environments.

R Cert is a piece of the bigger picture: how does this tie into the other working groups/teams.

Assumptions of the playing field for R Certification
	- Infrastructure set up
	- Working with a set of authorized R Packages (point to R Validation Hub)

WG Action Items:
	- Move these notes to R Markdown doc on github (Kate)
	- Move meeting to zoom (Mehar)
	- Meet with Rafi, Mike and Joe (not Joe R) in interim to draft 
	Actions
		        1. QC --> 
		        2. mapping the data to "norm" --> 
		        3. mock annotated --> 
		        4. programming of that TLF 
            
Review at June 9th meeting
