From last time:
Kieran provided an outline for R Foundational Skills (upoloaded to github)
Joseph K also provided an outline for R Modelling (uploaded to github) and is working on generating code.

Discussion:
Temptation to make it more elaborate and make a book out of it. Should we point to resources or write a book? 
  We should keep it foundational and technical focused.
For survival modelling: point to task view. 1-2 tutorials to point to on the modelling/statistics.
Our focus should be on the technical approach and providing example code ("flavor"). 
- strong statement as to data wrangling and graphics: tidyverse foudnational skills
- table creation and manipulation: RTRS tie in; point to gt gtsummary as foundational skills; rtables open on github?

Action Items:
- add template docs to Github for remaining sections (Kate)
- first draft of the Clinical Trials Overview section (Kate)
- first draft outdata section (Rafi)

Next meeting 10/29 at 11AM PT
