General:

- 50 Questions in total, multiple choice 

Needs

- Beta exam platform 
- Certiverse platform 
	- Platform proposed for the project 
	- JTA
	- Item writing 
- Content has to be written in the exam item by item 
- 80% of the material is good to go 
- Putting an exam into certiverse brings in the SMEs that have written the content 
	- Peer review of the content 
- Review team for content (part 1) 
- Do you need some more diversity in who has authority for what content? (part 2)
- People are coming and going for the enterprise 
	- Volunteer enterprise for the meeting (6-7 people devoted)
- Shy away from one content that will attribute towards one exam 
- Data entry into certiverse 
	- This is single data entry for questions



Questions/Concerns: 


- Do we want a review path for final pass on content?
	- If you have the 6-7 SMEs to work on the content as the data entry folks 
	- Can operate as a set of SME colleagues for peer review on content 
- Can we bundle things together in CSV for data entry? 
	- No its not possible
- Is there anything we can use with an API? 
	- No there is not. It must be manual entry 
- Do you have domains and the sub topics for comptencies? 
	- Sub categories isnt something that was explored for our group
	- Topics that are covered by these items
	- This will be used for the exam blueprint
- Using SME do some of the leg work and defininig the weights for each section of the exam
- Can we use the beta exam to determine the weights of each section? 
	- Its possible to use the statistics for the weight of it 
	- Early SME establish the weights before the exam 
- Alpha test for the pre exam 
	- Small group alpha test and then go to a beta exam 
		- Generally needs one beta for the exam 
	- This is time consuming and LOE to it 
	- Smaller group for friends and family of R (alpha test with feedback)
