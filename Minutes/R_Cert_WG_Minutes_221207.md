## General: 

- Considering R Certification as a revenue certificaiton is ready 
- This certification is part of the clinical setting in pharma for SAS to R 
- Linux foundation are not the experts in the industry for academia
- General challenge is that tech folks are very familiar with the exam quesitons 
	- 3 people try to memorize 10-20 questions and the next day items are on the web
	- It could be a simple memory exercise 
	- Tends to be a larger quantity of people looking at the exam platform 
		- High upside of passing or high downside of passing 
- We are still trying to estimate the  amount of people interested in the market
	- The work this group has done sets a precursor for other exams at the very least
- Scaling of the exam and going through the development process 
	- Alpha, beta and at launch we should have the audience identified 
	- Not a thing you need to have the marketing team for alpha and beta for decision makers 
		- Would prescore it 


## Exam Format: 

- Multiple source/multiple choice model 
	- Has 50-60 exam items 
		- Requires a lot of work to have the items written

- Mix multiple choice with performance base 
	- Skill base. Runs 45 minutes and have fewer items for the exam 
		- Lab oriented performance based 

- Has to have the committed team that knows the material (Subject Matter Experts)
	- Team can work on development questions 
	- Exams are harder and harder 

- Can defend against cheating with open response 
	- We can offer the exams at a limited window for taking the exam
- 1.5 minute per question is rule of thumb (75-90 minutes is estimate)
	- We need to think about the difficulty of the bias of the exam
	- Subject matter experts will come in and set the cut score 
		- Will be an aggregate value of the scores and then averaged


	

## Exam Hosting: 


- Ceriverse is the platform and have a means for delivering different forms (another test)
	- Creating another bank of items 
		- Another 50 and then another question 
		- 10 can be in pretest and constantly staging the entry into items
- There can be a proctor hosting for the exam. Schedule 24 hours for the exam
	- They will close out the exam and give them an okay
	- Desktop is recorded during the exam



Exam Cost: 

- We are trying to estimate a small fee (300 dollars for the exam)
- The multiple choice by Linux foundation are 250 already
- Rough rule of thumb is for certiverse 
	- 20% to them
	- support fee for 30 bucks in hard cost for platform 
		- Remainder is the training team and project 
		- proctoring is $18/session


Next Steps: 

- Set up a meeting for the next steps 
- Check out certiverse for platform
- Would be a certification exam and candidate experience
