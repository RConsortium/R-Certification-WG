Updates from Joe R.
Submissions WG:
	- Moving forward with preparing for a pilot clinical trial
	- See github page -- task boards
	- Planning for 3 submissions (simple 2 packages with CDISC datasets; documentation from CDISC) - submit everything as a txt document; code, packages and txt docs -- over gateway ; instructions for how to unpack and FDA can access analysis;
Tables WG:
	- Working through a document with requirements
	- Deciding what is absolutely necessary; reqs doc will include table of essentials and what R packages cover
	- Which code should you actually use? Depends on what you want to do (tables vs visualizations)
PHUSE WG: Clinical Reporting in a multi-lingual trial
	- Linear, survival, mixed… differences between SAS and R
	- Number of 'phenomenon' - judgement call to provide an estimate; SAS and R do different things (provide an estimator vs not); drives responsibility back to the statistician; should know (not depend) on the statistical packages output without knowing the default settings and assumptions

		○ Joseph to ask for Access for a few of our team members
		○ Examples to Github (Joseph Rickert to find link)
		https://github.com/phuse-org/CSRMLW
		

CRAN 
	- Changed exchange on github;
	- Manifesto on github to Linux Foundation… 
	https://github.com/cranchange/cran_change.org
	- R Foundation directly with CRAN diplomatic? 
	- New WG devoted to repository issues 
		○ Timing of engaging between CRAN and FDA
			§ CRAN doesn't want a lot of submissions
			§ Holding off on updates to CRAN
			§ But then FDA doesn't have what it needs…
			§ Buffer strategy 
		○ Joseph looks at new packages on CRAN monthly. Then looks at and analyzes new packages. Usually finds about 10-12 packages that are removed. Authors don't understand

Kieran: Chinese Health Authorities may not allow submissions in R; usually CHA follows FDA; Roche trying to influence, reach out to people. Not sure if it's a strong/formal announcement - currently word of mouth.
	Kieran to look into if there is more information.
	
CDISC and Background
Expected Workflows:
    Clean → Build Dataset → Analyze → Report
(data steps, SQL) (merge, join, sql) (linear regression or other model) (proc report)
	• SAS 
	• R
	• R examples
		○ Use a Public CDISC study/datasets
_______
Financials side:
	• goal is self-sustaining
	• Outsourcing needs:
		○ proctoring (see linux foundation)
		○ Building the exam and checking it for accuracy (can search for companies that do this)
		○ Curriculum design and training platform
Joe: need to develop draft document or paper first before asking for financials
Keiran: need to write out who exactly are our audience.
