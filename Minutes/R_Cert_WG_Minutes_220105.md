Joe R: 
  
-R Working Group is showing the differences between some of the modeling techniques between SAS and R
-SAS is not a complete language for expressiveness of the data 
-We should look to highlight some of the differences between the modeling outputs in R and SAS
      - Survival Analysis
      - Mixed-Effect Modeling 
-We should try to get separated from what you should know and the test/certify components 
      - We shouldnt be trying to completely teach someone R
-What do we need to include to get SAS people off to a good start and what does R users need to know about SAS
      -Steps to get the dataset and what do you do for R modeling/statistics 
          -Commonalities for the "company culture" and pulling the datasets
              -Shortcuts to programming --> Dump everything into a database
-Is tidyverse good enough to be done with data manipulation? 
      -Users should be familiar in indexing in R and base packages 
              -Lets list some based packages in R
                -Is lme4 a package that we should be familiarizing users with? Believe so. broom package should be something  to discuss.
-We are certifying the combination of the combination of R and SAS in order to utilize programming in a bilingual
  - What do you need to know in R to perform statistical computations, get data, etc if you are coming from SAS. 
              

Kieran: 
  - Ongoing discussions lead by Roche and GSK building a pharmaverse 
        - Admiral package is in early stages. Plurality of the pharma company that may utilize R core work. 
        - Awareness of the packages that could be used for the working group. 
  -Base level document is that we would give a brief level overview of the datasets. We should start sketching out ideas that we expect users to be familiar 
        -Provide resources for R that we expect people to know in an outline 
            -Not providing step by step instructions, but resources that would be useful (Advanced R book)
  -Its not straight forward for users to use "summary" to generate the output for the user 
  -There are still a lot to be done for the tools to be used. We should consider what is being maintained. 



Joe K:
  -DOE work needs to be uploaded to the github repo after review
  -Identify some particular baysesian analysis that would be useful. Simple implementation for example and mention another popular solution 
  -Check to see Bayesian mixed-modeling is in practice


Update: 
  -DOE modeling needs to be uploaded to the github repo
  -Define base packages in R and base level fundamental core in R packages and tutorial points 
  

Assignments: 
  -Ashley - Look into getting some outlines in the SAS to R differences for R modeling from SAS perspective 
  -Joe K - Continue modeling for R. Look into some Bayesian common approaches in R and email out material 
  -Mike - Will work to put together some base level packages R users should be familiar with
  -Joe R - Look into some tutorial references for what is currently useful in R for users 
  -Kieran - expanding base foundation document with relevant analysis 
  -Kaitlin - Put together some material for certification preparation
