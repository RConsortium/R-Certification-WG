1) What package is used to reproduce SAS's predictions for linear modeling at combinations of specified factors? 

- ANOVA
- lsmeans (c)
- ISLR
- psych
- dplyr

2) Given the code snippet below, what is the expected value of "output"?

output <- lm(PostTreatment ~ Drug + PreTreatment, data = anova)

-ANOVA table of PostTreatment
-Variance/Covariance Matrix of Drug and PreTreatment
-Linear Model of PostTreatment as depdendent variable (c)
-Mixed-Effect model of PostTreatment as dependent variable
-Residual analysis of anova dataset

3) Which package is used to perform survival analysis in R?

-psych
-dplyr
-sminer
-surry
-survival (c)

4) Given the linear mixed effect modeling function below, what is the fixed variable? 

melm <- lmer(AVAL~ (1|SITEGR1)+BASE+TRTPN,data=mlm_sub, REML = FALSE)

-BASE
-TRTPN
-SITEGR1 (c)
-AVAL
-All variables not fixed

5) What is the expected output of the code snippet below?

  lung %>% 
  filter(status == 2) %>% 
  summarize(median_survival = median(time))

-finds the median survial time for status == 2 (c)
-group lung dataframe for status == 2
-remove status == 2 from lung dataframe
-provide summary statistics for lung dataframe where status==2
-filter lung dataset to status==2 and determine median status for survival 

6) What function would be used to pass a dataframe object (x) and output a covariance matrix?

-covariance(x)
-c.variance(x)
-covar(x)
-variance(x, type=covariance)
-cov(x) (c)

7) Given the command below, what does the output produce?

cor(df[,-1])

-a correlation matrix excluding the first column (c)
-a correlation matrix excluding the last column 
-pearson's correlation of the last column
-pearson's correlation of the first column
-none of the above 

8) Given the code snippet below, what is the expected output?

sapply(data,function(x)sum(is.na(x)))

-sum the number of NAs in dataframe and output vector (c)
-replace all missing values with NA in data
-impute missing values with 0 in dataframe 
-none of the above
-sum the number of NAs in colun and output vector

9) What does the code snippet below perform?

pnorm(q=-0.77, lower.tail=TRUE)

-finds p-value with a z-score of -0.77 of left-tail test (c)
-finds p-value with a z-score of -0.77 of right-tail test
-take the interquartile range of dataframe
-creates normality test of a numeric vector
-A or B

10) To utilize survival package's modeling capabilites how must your dataset be passed as arguement?

-as a tibble 
-as a dataframe
-as either tibble or dataframe (c)
-without missing data in any row
-none of the above
